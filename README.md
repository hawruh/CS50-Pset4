# CS50-Pset4

The recover assignment from problem set 4 from Harvards CS50 course.

This program searches raw binary files for jpeg signatures. If found, it copies the jpeg(s) into a newly created file(s).

I created the program specifically for the problem set, so it will only retrieve up to 52 jpegs.
